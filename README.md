"# useAsync-react-hook"
Create a custom hook that takes a handler function, fn.
Define a reducer function and an initial state for the custom hook's state.
Use the useReducer() hook to initialize the state variable and the dispatch function.
Define an asynchronous run function that will run the provided callback, fn, while using dispatch to update state as necessary.
Return an object containing the properties of state (value, error and loading) and the run function.
